1) use snort to detect attack 
2) Do the attack
3) once snort alert file changes send ICMP ping to leased ips (have to get list of IPs from DHCP server)
	3.1) wait for replies
	3.2) if replied --> legitimate
	3.3) if not replied --> malicious
-----------
  	3.4) counter-measure the defence:
		3.4.1) option 1: Attaker should reply to all ICMP echos --> tcpdump -i wlan0 -e icmp[icmptype] == 8 -v -n
		3.4.2) option 2: Attacker keeps a list of IP-MAC addresses leased and reply to them only
-----------
	3.5) in the case of:
		3.5.1) option 1: the server can count the number of echo replies he gets --> if more than 1 then there is a malicious user
        3.5.2) option 2: DHCP server loses in this technique

Setup:

Computer 1: wlan0 --> Fake AP with DHCP Server
	    	wlan1 --> Snort for detecting DHCP Starvation and ICMP Signalling
	   		wlan1 --> launch DHCP Starvation attack
___________________________________
Detection and signaling Details:

Snort: 
	Snort is used to detect large number of DHCP DISCOVER and DHCP REQUEST messages
	alerts are reported to an alert text file to be monitored by final.py

final.py:
	watches the alert file of snort for changes
	once it is modified, it reads all leased IPs from the DHCP server, and then
	it calls a function from ping.py
	based on the result it identifies the user as legitimate or malicious

ping.py:
	an implimentation of ping in python used to ping users
